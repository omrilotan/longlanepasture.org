		<h2>Regulations</h2>

			You are invited to quietly enjoy Long Lane Pasture. Please respect the
			environment and take care to keep any disturbance to a minimum. The
			following Regulations, made under clause 3.20 of the Trust Deed of Long
			Lane Pasture Trust (LLPT), are aimed at protecting the site for the

		<h3>Opening times</h3>
		<p>
			Opening times vary. We try to keep the pasture open on Saturdays and
			Sundays from 10am to dusk. The Pasture may be closed in winter due to
			adverse weather conditions and flooding. LLPT may close or restrict access
			from time to time. Groups may visit the Pasture by arrangement at other
			times.

			No vehicle or equipment, whether power driven or not, may be brought onto
			the Pasture without the prior permission of LLPT. This general prohibition
			on vehicles and equipment includes, but is not confined to, lorries, cars,
			motorbikes, bicycles, roller skates and skateboards. Wheelchairs or
			similar for people with disabilities are permitted.
		</p>

		<h3>Food and Drink</h3>
