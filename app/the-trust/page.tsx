				The Trust was established in April 2006 in order to protect, restore and
				manage the Pasture. It holds a 25 year lease from London Borough of
				Barnet and is responsible for maintaining and safeguarding the land for
				the benefit of the community. The Trust took over the assets and
				replaced the now defunct Long Lane Pasture Action Group, a pressure
				group set up to prevent houses being build on the land.
			</p>
			<p>
				Long Lane Pasture Trust relies on donations to protect, maintain and
				restore the Pasture. It has received generous grants from the Postcode
				Lottery Trust, Panton Trust, Rowse Honey, Big Lottery (Awards For All
				and BBC Breathing Places), the City Bridge Trust, the Milly Apthorp
				Charitable Trust, Grassroots Grants, and Neighbourhood Renewal.
				Organisations which have supported our work include BTCV, The Finchley
				Society, and The Barnet Federation of Allotment Societies. Above all, we
				have received many donations from individuals without whose
				contributions we would not have been able to safeguard this land.
			</p>
			<p>
				We appreciate all donations, large or small. If you would like to make a
				donation, please visit our <NavigationLink to="contribute" /> page.
